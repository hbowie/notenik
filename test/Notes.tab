Commands for Hank	Dogs		## Taught * **Sit**: The dog is in a sitting position. * **Down**: A dog is typically down when its elbows (front feet) and hocks (rear legs) are touching the ground or floor. * **Stay**: The dog must remain in the position (sit, down, stand) and location under which the command was given until it is released by the handler. * **Wait**: The wait command lets your dog know that he'll be verbally released fairly quickly, either to something he wants, like a meal, or to perform another job for you, like a recall or a retrieve. You might be right next to your dog when you release him, or you might be some distance away. The wait command tells your dog, “Hold on a second, something else is coming.” * **Drop or drop it**: Dogs pick up all sorts of things, some of which they shouldn't have. A dog that drops anything on command, no matter how attractive (and "attractive" to a dog can be "rotten and smelly" to a human), is a dog under control that the owner can prevent from eating dangerous items or from destroying valued personal property. * **Leave it**: An adjunct to Drop, directing the dog to not touch an item. Also useful before the dog has picked anything up. Leave it is also used in conjunction with Take it. * **Take it**: The dog leaves a desired object, such as a toy or treat, untouched until given this command. * **Roll Over**: When taught this command a dog will lie down and roll over. * **Crate**: Get in the crate. ## Working On * **Heel**: The dog's head or shoulder is parallel to the handler's leg on the left side of the handler. * **Come**: (referred to as the recall) "Call your dog" equals "come" or "here". * **Back up** – keepers of large dogs or dogs with a reputation for aggressiveness can make strangers more comfortable by teaching the dog to back up on command. * **Stand** – dog stands still. Useful for grooming. Many dogs are groomed frequently and need to stand quietly during the process. * **Go to bed**: Directs the dog to go to its bed or its crate and to remain there until released. The dog has freedom of movement in that location to stand up, turn around, or lie down, unlike when placed in a Stay. Useful to keep a dog out from underfoot and safe in a busy or complicated situation. * **Give**: The dog has an object in its mouth and "gives" it to its owner by releasing the object into the owner's hand. Object of choice in training is usually a light-weight dumbbell or a glove.  This is useful for when your dog has one of your belongings and you want it back before the dog hides it or chews it up. * **With me**: used when walking your dog to keep them at your side and with your pace. ## Reference [Wikipedia - Obedience Training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience_training#Basic_commands) [netplaces]: (http://www.netplaces.com/dog-obedience/the-fine-art-of-stay/the-difference-between-wait-and-stay.htm)
