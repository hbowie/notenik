		<p>
			I&#8217;ve been programming computers for over four decades now, and over time I&#8217;ve become increasingly interested in how to simplify the storage and manipulation of data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having information stored in a bunch of proprietary, closed formats, usable only with specific associated applications, seems unnecessarily restrictive and inefficient.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let me try an analogy to explain my perspective.
		</p>
		<p>
			What if bank accounts didn&#8217;t exist? What if, when someone paid you money for something, you had to decide where you wanted to spend it before you could receive it? Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m being paid $500, so I decide to put $100 in my grocery store account, $300 in my utilities account, and $100 in an account belonging to my favorite neighborhood restaurant. That wouldn&#8217;t be very convenient, would it? And once you know how bank accounts work, it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense to manage your finances without them, would it?
		</p>
		<p>
			To me, that&#8217;s similar to the situation many of us face with computers today. Let&#8217;s say I want to create some information about a new business I want to launch. So I decide to put some of the information in my Microsoft Word account, some in my PowerPoint account, and some in my QuickBooks account. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to be able to create the information first, and later have the flexibility to later move it around however and whenever I want?
		</p>
		<h2 id="overview">
			Overview
		</h2>
		<p>
			Notenik is really three things: a data format, a set of Java classes for reading and writing information in this format, and a Java desktop application that enables users to create and access notes in this format.
		</p>
		<h2 id="the-notenik-data-format">
			The Notenik Data Format
		</h2>
		<p>
			Computer information generally falls into one of two types:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					A table of columns and rows, with each column containing a certain type of data, and identified by a specific field name, or column heading.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					A document containing sections, paragraphs and words.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Of course, if you have a collection of documents, then you may well represent that list of documents using a table in which each row represents a different document.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Notenik data format is an attempt to accommodate both of these basic types of computer information: tables and documents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each note represents a single document, and each note may also contain specific fields. The fields come first, followed by the body of the document.
		</p>
		<p>
			A Notenik collection may be represented as a table, with each specific field appearing as a separate column, and each note appearing as a row in the table.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of data storage, each note is stored as a separate text file, in the [UTF-8][utf8] format, capable of being read and modified by any text editor, on almost any computer system in the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			A Notenik collection is stored as a folder (aka directory) containing one or more notes. A collection resides on a local disk or file share, but may be synced to the cloud and to other devices and users via a service such as [Dropbox][].
		</p>
		<p>
			The document portion of each note may be formatted using [Markdown][md] conventions. The fields appear first in the file, and are formatted using the [metadata][meta] conventions used by [MultiMarkdown][mmd]; that is, each line starts with a field name, followed by a colon, followed by at least one character of white space, followed by the field&#8217;s value. The field value may be specified on the same line, and/or on one or more following lines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each field name may be considered to have a
			<em>
				proper name
			</em>
			(including capitalization, spaces and punctuation), and a
			<em>
				common name
			</em>
			(the proper name without capitalization, whitespace or punctuation). The common name is considered to be the key for the field, so that any variations of the name that include the same letters and digits in the same sequence will be considered equivalent.
		</p>
		<p>
			A note file may be stored with any of the following file extensions:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				.markdown
			</li>
			<li>
				.md
			</li>
			<li>
				.mdown
			</li>
			<li>
				.mdtext
			</li>
			<li>
				.mkdown
			</li>
			<li>
				.nnk
			</li>
			<li>
				.notenik
			</li>
			<li>
				.text
			</li>
			<li>
				.txt
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			At one end of a continuum, a note may contain an unlimited number of fields with any field names. More commonly, though, a note will contain a certain number of typical fields. These typical fields, also known as the Notenik core fields, are defined as follows.
		</p>
		<h3 id="title">
			Title
		</h3>
		<p>
			Each note in a collection must have a unique title. If the contents of the note file does not contain a title field, then the file name (without the extension) will be used as the title of the note.
		</p>
		<h3 id="tags">
			Tags
		</h3>
		<p>
			Tags may be used to group related notes into categories. One or more tags may be associated with each note, and each tag may contain one or more sub-tags. A period or a slash may be used to separate one level of a tag from the next level, with the period being preferred. A comma or a semi-colon may be used to separate one tag from another, with the comma being preferred.
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#8220;Favorites&#8221; tag may be used to identify favored notes within a collection. The &#8220;Startup&#8221; tag may be used to identify notes you wish to have opened by an application when it first starts.
		</p>
		<h3 id="link">
			Link
		</h3>
		<p>
			A Hyperlink (aka URL).
		</p>
		<h3 id="author">
			Author
		</h3>
		<p>
			The author(s) of the note.
		</p>
		<h3 id="rating">
			Rating
		</h3>
		<p>
			Your rating of the note, on a scale of one to five.
		</p>
		<h3 id="type">
			Type
		</h3>
		<p>
			The type of note.
		</p>
		<h3 id="status">
			Status
		</h3>
		<p>
			The state of the note, indicating its degree of completion. Each possible status value consists of a single integer in the range of 0 - 9, plus an accompanying label. The integer allows the values to be sorted into a meaningful sequence, while the label provides a brief definition for each status value. The following status values are normally used.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					0 - Suggested

		</ul>
		<h3 id="date">
			Date
		</h3>
		<p>
			The date of the note, such as the date the note was officially published, or a due date for the note. The date may be expressed in any of a number of common formats. It may also be a partial date, such as a year, or a year and a month. It may or may not contain a specific time of day.
		</p>
		<h3 id="mod-date">

		<p>
			This is the last modification of the note, as maintained by the file system (not specified within the contents of the note).
		</p>
		<h3 id="file-size">
			File Size
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is the size of the file, in characters, as maintained by the file system (not specified within the contents of the note).
		</p>
		<h3 id="teaser">
			Teaser
		</h3>
		<p>
			An excerpt from the note used as a teaser in a list of notes. The teaser may be formatted using Markdown.
		</p>
		<h3 id="body">
			Body
		</h3>
		<p>
			The body, or primary text, of the note. In this case the field value is expected on following lines. The Body field will always be treated as the final field in a note, to avoid having portions of the document inadvertently treated as fields.

		<h3 id="introduction">
			Introduction
		</h3>
		<p>
			Notenik is a desktop software program to help a single user maintain multiple collections of notes.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may well ask why the world needs yet another note-taking app and, in truth, I&#8217;m not sure it does. However, whether it wants or needs one or not, it has one, and so I will try to explain why I&#8217;ve have labored to give birth to such a thing at this late date.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here were my design goals for the app.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Each note stored as a plain text file.
					</strong>
					This ensures that the notes can be edited on any device, by any text editor, and allows the notes to be painlessly synced between devices using a service such as Dropbox.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Ability to handle multiple collections of notes.
					</strong>
					I really don&#8217;t want to be limited to a single collection. With Notenik, create as many folders of notes as you like.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Embedded, platform-independent tags.
					</strong>
					I want to be able to tag my notes, and see them organized by tags, but I want the tags to move with the notes when the notes get synced between devices, and I want the tags to be editable with any text editor that can be used to edit the notes themselves.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Bookmarks too.
					</strong>
					Add a URL to a note, and it becomes a bookmark. So now I can create a separate folder just for bookmarks, and organize them by tags, all with the same little app.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>
						A file format that is simple to read and simple to edit.
					</strong>
					No XML, no HTML, just some flexible, quasi-markdown formatting.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Make sense?
		</p>
		<p>
			If so, read on.
		</p>
		<p>
			If not, just move along &#8212; this is not the app you were looking for.
		</p>
		<h3 id="getting-started">
			Getting Started
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					System Requirements Notenik is written in Java and can run on any reasonably modern operating system, including Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Notenik requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), also known as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The version of this JRE/JVM must be at least 6. Visit
				<a href="http://www.java.com">
					www.java.com
				</a>
				to download a recent version for most operating systems. Installation happens a bit differently under Mac OS X, but generally will occur fairly automatically when you try to launch a Java app for the first time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because Notenik may be run on multiple platforms, it may look slightly different on different operating systems, and will obey slightly different conventions (using the CMD key on a Mac, vs. an ALT key on a PC, for example).

		<p>
			Notenik can work with multiple collections of notes for each user. However, only one collection can be open at a time. Each collection is stored on disk in a separate folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following commands apply to collections.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Purge Purges closed notes from the current collection, with an option to save purged notes into a separate archive folder.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Preferences
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Folder Sync Prefs The Folder Sync application prefs pane allow the user to identify a common folder to which several different Notenik collections can be synced.
						</p>
						<p>
							The common folder may then be conveniently accessed using nvAlt.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each collection can have a different prefix assigned, and that prefix will then be used to keep the notes from the different collections separately identified within the common nvAlt folder. The prefix will default to the folder name for the collection, with a trailing &#8216;s&#8217; removed if one is found, and with a dash added as a separator. A folder name of &#8216;Bookmarks&#8217;, for example, would result in a prefix of &#8216;Bookmark - &#8217; being appended to the front of each note as it is stored in the common folder.
						</p>
						<p>
							The logic for the syncing works as follows.
						</p>
						<p>
							A sweep of the entire common folder will be performed whenever syncing is first turned on for a collection, and henceforth whenever a collection with syncing already on is opened.
						</p>
						<p>
							The sweep sync includes the following logic.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									For any nvAlt notes with a matching prefix, where the corresponding note does not already exist within the Notenik collection, the note will be added to the Notenik collection.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									For any Notenik notes where a matching nvAlt note is not found, the note will be added to the nvAlt folder.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									For any Notenik notes where a matching nvAlt note has been updated more recently than the matching Notenik note, the Notenik note will be updated to match the nvAlt note.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Once folder sync has been turned on for a collection, then every time that Notenik makes an update to any note within that collection, a parallel update will be made to the corresponding note within the common folder.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Tags Export Prefs These fields allow you to specify tags to be used to tailor your exports, controlling the data that is exported.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Tags to Suppress Any tags specified here will be removed from all tags fields appearing on exports. This may be useful to suppress tags used for selection at Publish time, as opposed to tags that will appear in the eventual output being created.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Tags to Select Leave this blank to select all tags on any export, including a data export performed as part of a Publish process. Specifying one or more tags here will limit the content of the export to items containing at least one of those tags.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Files Prefs These fields provide some automated processing for folders containing note collections.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Backup Frequency Choose one of the following options.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											Occasional Suggestions
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Automatic Backups
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Manual Only
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Number of Recent Files Specify the number of recent files to make available for easy opening.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									At startup, open Automatically open the last file opened, or automatically open a specific file each time Notenik is launched.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Purge inaccessible files If a recent file can’t be accessed, then choose one of the following options for dealing with this situation.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											Now
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>

					template.txt file By default, Notenik shows only four fields for a Note: Title, Link, Tags and Body. However, this default may be altered by placing a file named ‘template.txt’ within a Collection’s folder. Such a file should be in the normal Notenik format, although the field names specified need not have any accompanying data. When such a file is found, the field names found in this file will be used as the fields to be displayed and maintained for that Collection. This file should be created using a text editor — not using the Notenik app itself for this purpose.
