Introduction

Notenik is a desktop software program to help a single user maintain multiple collections of notes.

You may well ask why the world needs yet another note-taking app and, in truth, I'm not sure it does. However, whether it wants or needs one or not, it has one, and so I will try to explain why I've have labored to give birth to such a thing at this late date. 

Here were my design goals for the app. 

1. **Each note stored as a plain text file.** This ensures that the notes can be edited on any device, by any text editor, and allows the notes to be painlessly synced between devices using a service such as Dropbox.

2. **Ability to handle multiple collections of notes.** I really don't want to be limited to a single collection. With Notenik, create as many folders of notes as you like. 

3. **Embedded, platform-independent tags.** I want to be able to tag my notes, and see them organized by tags, but I want the tags to move with the notes when the notes get synced between devices, and I want the tags to be editable with any text editor that can be used to edit the notes themselves. 

4. **Bookmarks too.** Add a URL to a note, and it becomes a bookmark. So now I can create a separate folder just for bookmarks, and organize them by tags, all with the same little app. 

5. **A file format that is simple to read and simple to edit.** No XML, no HTML, just some flexible, quasi-markdown formatting. 

Make sense?

If so, read on. 

If not, just move along -- this is not the app you were looking for.
